we can read of things that happened 5000 vears ago in the Near Eastwhe ere people tirst learned to write.But there are some parts of the word where even now people cannot write. The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas -- legends handed down from one generation of another.These leger ads are useful because they cantell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they di d.Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from.The sagas o these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.But the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even thei sagas, if they had anyare forgotten.So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the firstmodern men' came from.Fortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stoneespecially flintbeca ause this is easier to shape than other kinds.They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away.Stone does not decay,a ind so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.
