As a little boy, there was nothing I liked better than Suno ay aftemoons at my grandfather's farm in western Pennsylvania. Surrounded by m hiles of winding stonewalls, the house and barn provided endless hours of fun for a city kid l ke me. I was used to parlors neat as a pin that seemed to whisper, "Not to be touched!"I can still remember one afternoon when I was eight years s old. Since my first visit to the farm, I'd wanted more than anything to be allowed to climb th he stonewalls surrounding the property. My parents would never approve. The walls were olo; some stones were missing. others loose and crumbling. Still, my yearning to scramble acr ross those walls grew so strong. One spring afternoon, I summoned all my courage and entere ed the living room, where the adults had gathered after dinner."I, uh, I want to climb the stonewalls," I said hesitantly. Eve eryone looked up. "Can I climb the stonewalls?" Instantly a chorus went up from the women i n the room. "Heavens, no!" they cried in dismay. "You'll hurt yourself!" I wasn't too disappointe d; the response was just as l'd expected. But before I could leave the room, I was stopped by my grandfather' s booming voice. "Hold on just a minute," I heard him say, "Let the boy c imb the stonewalls. He has to learn to do things for himself.""Scoot," he said to me with a wink, "and come and see me when you get back." For the next two and a half hours 1 climbed those old walls and had the time of my life. Later I met with my grandfather to tell him about my adventure. Iâ€™ll never forget what he said. "Fred," he said, grinning, "you made this day a special day just by being yourself. Always remember there's only one person in this whole world like you, and i like you exactly as you are."
